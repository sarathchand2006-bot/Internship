This SQL script demonstrates basic data retrieval and filtering techniques using a single table of employees.
The goal is to practice fundamental SQL concepts that are essential for most data-related roles.

Data Retrieval Query
   - Retrieves Marketing employees hired in 2023 whose last name starts with 'D'.
   - Sorts results by hire date in ascending order.
   - 
Validation Query
   - Checks the filtered result for:
     - Total number of rows (`COUNT(*)`)
     - Minimum salary (`MIN(salary)`)
     - Latest hire date (`MAX(hire_date)`)
   - Ensures the filters and conditions are applied correctly.

      Selecting specific columns with aliases
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, and `LIKE`
- Sorting results with `ORDER BY`
- Validating data using aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
